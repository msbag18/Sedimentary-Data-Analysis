# Sedimentary-Data-Analysis
The code attached in R Markdown files aim to analyse sedimentary data from n different locations. This is done in three steps as has been broken down in the files:

1. Initialising the raw data files with quick summary statistics;
2. Understanding part 1 and classifying it into its corresponding data distribution type for more accurate analysis;
3. Qunatitatively visualising the data and inference of the later into meaningful figures.

In order to reproduce this analysis, you would require a two data files:
Data File 1: Erosion Rates (mine consisted of repeated erosion rate measurement at different locations of erodibility which is a parameter that depends on the soil composition and includes factors such as the sand, silt and clay fraction, as well as the organic content of the soil)
Data File 2: Locations (The geographical locations whereby the measurements were taken in terms of northings(N) and eastings(E), the meausured erosion rates, other variables related to erosion rates which in our case were topography(S) and number of tree cover(t) and soil composition)
