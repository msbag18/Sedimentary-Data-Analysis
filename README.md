# Sedimentary-Data-Analysis
The code attached in the R Markdown file aims to analyse sedimentary data from n different locations. This is done in three steps as has been seperated in the RMarkdown file into subtitled sections. The three steps were as follows:

1. Initialising the raw data files with quick summary statistics;
2. Understanding part 1 and classifying the latter into its corresponding data distribution type for more accurate analysis;
3. Quantitative visualisation of the data and inference of the later into meaningful figures.

In order to reproduce this analysis, you would require a two data files:

Data File 1: Erosion Rates -
The raw data file I used consisted of duplicate meausurements of erodibility at each locations.

Data File 2: Locations - 
The raw data file I used consisted of: 
1. The geographical locations in terms of northings(N) and eastings(E);
2. The measured erosion rates at said locations (mER);
3. Other factors that influence erodibility which in our case were topography(S), tree cover(t) and soil composition (clay, silt and sand).
